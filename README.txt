Title: Maths Quiz Version 1.0
Author: Jake Mander

A brief summer project to brush up on C# and introduce myself to Github
and its functionallity. 

Program functions as a simple maths quiz designed to test the user
on a selection of randomly generated, simple, arithmetic questions.

The program has been developed using guidance from the MSDN, the source
for which, can be found at the bottom of this text file.

Subsequent iterations of the quiz will use more advanced techniques learnt during 
Programming II to improve the overall cleanliness and efficiency of the code.
